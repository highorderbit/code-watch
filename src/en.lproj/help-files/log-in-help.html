<p>
While it's possible to use Code Watch without providing your GitHub account,
you'll get a lot more out of the application if you do. You'll be able to
see your own private news feed of for your projects, and you'll have your
own "dashboard" where you can quickly access your own repositories.
</p>

<p>
If you provide your API token, you'll be able to keep up with your
private repositories as well as your public ones.

<h3>Username</h3>
<p>
Your username is simply your GitHub login. Pretty simple.
</p>

<h3>API Token</h3>
<p>
Your API token is what GitHub uses to provide third-party applications like Code
Watch with access to your private repositories and news feeds. We aren't
able to use it to retrieve your password, and you will never have to
provide your password to Code Watch.
</p>

<p>
Your API token can be found on your <a
    href="https://github.com/account"
    title="Your Account - GitHub">GitHub account page</a>. It's listed just
below your username.
</p>
