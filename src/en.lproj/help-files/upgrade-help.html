<h3>Private Repositories</h3>
<p>
The paid version of Code Watch provides you access to your private
repositories. The same repository list, commit activity, and commit details
that's provided for open source projects in Code Watch Open Source is
available when you upgrade to the full version of Code Watch.
</p>

<h3>Private News Feed</h3>
<p>
The paid version of Code Watch will show you the same news feed you see on
your GitHub dashboard on the "Home" tab. That includes all activity for your
private repositories, including private repositories owned by other users
that you're watching. Code Watch Open Source shows your public activity on
this page.
